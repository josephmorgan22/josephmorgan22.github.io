     <h3>1.1.3 Conclusion Questions</h3>
     <p>1.  Its a good idea because it helps us understand how code works and if you were to link it up with other code you know that that peace of code would work. </p>
     <br>
     <p>2. Other tasks that need trial and error are designing house,making sure bridges wont collapse when and earth quick happens and there the same because trial and error.</p>
      <br>
      <p>3.It worked out really well and next time i would like to comunicate more with the partner.</p>
      <br>
      <p>4.Becuase it it going back and forth and doing a little at a time </p>
      
     <br>
    <h3> 1.1.4 Questions</h3> 
      <p>1.Because it teaches us the basics of scratch instead of going all in</p>
      <br>
      <p>2.Events are the input and handlers are the output</p>
      <br>
      <p>Somethings could be the sriptes and how ther coded.Some details could be the sound and or the code</P>
     
     <br>
     <h3> 1.1.5 Questions</h3>
     <p>1.That you can focus on other things and you can code a bit faster</p>
   <br>
   <p>2.</p>
      <br>
      <p>3A. Google could have an accumulator also football beting sites </p>
      <br>
      <p>3B.Google would have one because you can look up anything you want and it looks at the word or something you looked up and calculates and fineds what you are looking for.</p>
       <br>
       <p>4.Accumulator finds new values as aggregations sums up all points in the current context</p>

      <p>1.1.7 Game and Story Project</p>
      <br>
      <p>The programming language is we have a Knight named Steve. Steve has been caught during a battle with a clan named the lords. Steve is taken to a dungeon to raught for the rest of his life.</p> 
      <br>
      <p> But they accidentally leave the door open where steve escapes. Steve gets out of the dungeon and finds a sword.He then enters the next room and seeâ€™s a guard where then he has a choice to kill the kight or flee out the first door</p>
      <br>
      <p >the left. If he kills the Knight he run into 3 other guards and he is killed. Or option 2 is he goes through the first door where he escapes and finds a rubie.The point of this program is use a one way flag and to have a goal to win.</p>
      <br> 
      <p> Another is that you have multiple levels or rooms for your game. My video illustrates that if you kill the knight you cannot go through the first door but if you don't kill the knight you are allowed to go through the door. </p>

    <p>1.2.3 Conclusion Questions </p>
    <br>
    <p>it's similar because the code bublles are the same but differnt because you dont use the start program bubble.</p>
      <br>
      <p>So that you can take it on the go rather than sitting at home or at a desk to play or communicate.</p>

      <br>
      <p>It gets longer and loger but very little change everytime</p>
      <br>
      <p>Pair up with someone whose birthday you do not know. Find out their birthday using binary search, asking whether their birthday is earlier or later in the year than each of your guesses. How many guesses might be required to guarantee you find out their birthday?</p>
